## Task 1 - Data Visualization

This repository contains my first task as a Data Science Intern at Prodigy Infotech.

## Objective
To perform data visualization using Python libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. The goal is to analyze and visualize the Titanic dataset to uncover meaningful insights.

## What I Did
- Loaded the Titanic dataset using Seaborn
- Explored the dataset with Pandas
- Created various visualizations to understand:
  - Passenger survival distribution
  - Survival rate by gender and class
  - Age and fare distributions
  - Correlation between different features

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Files
- `task1_data_viz.ipynb` â€“ Jupyter Notebook containing all code and visualizations

## What I Learned
- How to visualize datasets with Python
- How to use Seaborn for clean, informative graphs
- Importance of exploring data before modeling
